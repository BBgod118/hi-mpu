Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedomto share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License isintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--tomake sure the software is free for all its users. This General PublicLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's softwareand to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some otherFree Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you havethe freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can getit if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender therights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that youhave. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright thesoftware, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to makecertain that everyone understands that there is no warranty forthis free software. If the software is modified by someone elseand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what theyhave is not the original, so that any problems introduced byothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free programwill individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the programproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patentmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying,distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0.This License applies to any program or other work which contains anotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributedunder the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into anotherlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitationin the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification arenot covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The actof running the Program is not restricted, and the output from theProgram is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Program (independent of having been made by running theProgram). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1.You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's sourcecode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuouslyand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright noticeand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer tothis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any otherrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act oftransferring a copy, and you may at your optionoffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2.You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a)You must cause the modified files to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b)You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,that in whole or in part contains or is derived from theProgram or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c)If the modified program normally reads commands interactivelywhen run, you must cause it, when started running for suchinteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or displayan announcement including an appropriate copyright notice anda notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that youprovide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the programunder these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copyof this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactivebut does not normally print such an announcement, your workbased on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from theProgram, and can be reasonably considered independent and separateworks in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do notapply to those sections when you distribute them as separateworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of awhole which is a work based on the Program, the distributionof the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights orcontest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,the intent is to exercise the right to control the distributionof derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based onthe Program with the Program (or with a work based on theProgram) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium doesnot bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3.You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms ofSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a)Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable sourcecode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b)Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least threeyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than yourcost of physically performing source distribution, a completemachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, tobe distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 aboveon a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c)Accompany it with the information you received as to the offerto distribute corresponding source code. (This alternativeis allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only ifyou received the program in object code or executable formwith such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the workfor making modifications to it. For an executable work, completesource code means all the source code for all modules it contains,plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scriptsused to control compilation and installation of the executable.However, as a special exception, the source code distributedneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in eithersource or binary form) with the major components (compiler,kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executableruns, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offeringaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalentaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts asdistribution of the source code, even though third parties arenot compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Programexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attemptotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Programis void, and will automatically terminate your rights underthis License. However, parties who have received copies, orrights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5.You are not required to accept this License, since you havenot signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission tomodify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. Theseactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or anywork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of thisLicense to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
6.Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on theProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject tothese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictionson the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are notresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7.If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreementor otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If youcannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligationsunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as aconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution ofthe Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectlythrough you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and thisLicense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid orunenforceable under any particular circumstance, thebalance of the section is intended to apply and the sectionas a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringeany patents or other property right claims or to contestvalidity of any such claims; this section has the sole purposeof protecting the integrity of the free software distributionsystem, which is implemented by public license practices. Manypeople have made generous contributions to the wide range ofsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistentapplication of that system; it is up to the author/donor todecide if he or she is willing to distribute software throughany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what isbelieved to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8.If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,the original copyright holder who places the Program under thisLicense may add an explicit geographical distribution limitationexcluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted onlyin or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this Licenseincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9.The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the General Public License from time to time. Suchnew versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If theProgram specifies a version number of this License which appliesto it and "any later version", you have the option of followingthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any laterversion published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Programdoes not specify a version number of this License, you may chooseany version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10.If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to theauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by theFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; wesometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by thetwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our freesoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY

11.BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTYFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPTWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHERPARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OFTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOUASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12.IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITINGWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/ORREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FORDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIALDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDEREDINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OFTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDEROR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to beof the greatest possible use to the public, the bestway to achieve this is to make it free software whicheveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safestto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at leastthe "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C)<yyyy><name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public Licenseas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will beuseful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the impliedwarranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public Licensealong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,USA.

Also add information on how tocontact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a shortnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of authorGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for detailstype `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome toredistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show theappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commandsyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; theycould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" forthe program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program intoproprietary programs.If your program is a subroutine library, you mayconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with thelibrary.If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser GeneralPublic License instead of this License.
